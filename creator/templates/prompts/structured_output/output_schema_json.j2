# Overview
- You will build a complex output schema by assembling smaller, clearly defined chunks.
- **## Main Schema** is the wrapper that contains all other content.
- **## Modalities** specifies the exact JSON shape for each modality (slide type).
- Use `<description>` blocks as construction guidance only; they must **not** appear in the final JSON.
- `<format>` shows the canonical JSON structure.
- String values may contain meta information written in the format `"<...>"`.  
- Do not include the `<` or `>` characters themselves in your output. 
- In your final output, emit **pure JSON**—no type hints, no descriptions, no trailing commas.
- Always reply with the full JSON structure no matter what feedback is provided by the user.
- CREATE VALID JSON. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OWN COMMENTS.
- Use HTML-tags such as strong, headlines, or paragraph to structure the content in each modality.


# Schemas
## Main Schema
<description>
- This is the overarching schema structure.
- Populate the `slides` array with modalities of your choice, selected from those listed in **## Modalities**.
</description>
<format>
```json
{   
    "report": "<A comment or description on how you created the learning unit or implemented user feedback.> [english]"
    "title":"<Descriptive title for this learning unit.>",
    "slides":[{% for modality in modalities %}{% if modality.selected %}{{modality.id}}{% endif %}{% if not loop.last %} | {% endif %}{% endfor %}]
}
```
</format>

## Modality Schemas
{% for modality in modalities %}{% if modality.selected %}
### {{modality.id}}
<description>
{{modality.description}}
</description>
<format>
```json
{{modality.format}}
```
</format>

{% endif %}{% endfor %}
